### ‚öôÔ∏è Current Focus

- **Network Automation** (Python, Ansible) to streamline configurations and deployments  
- **Security** with Cisco ASA, Firewalls, ACLs, and CyberOps best practices  
- **Cloud** (Azure,AWS) for scalable, secure infrastructure  
- Pursuing advanced automation projects to enhance efficiency and reduce downtime

### üõ†Ô∏è Projects

- **Network Automation with Python & Ansible**  

  -  Developed an Ansible based automation framework to configure and manage Cisco routers in a virtualized lab (CML). Automated repetitive tasks like device provisioning, configuration backups, and verification, reducing manual effort by 40% and improving deployment efficiency.
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[View Repository](https://github.com/NetEngSam/Cisco-Ansible-Python-Lab)
  - **Tech Stack:** Ansible, Cisco Router, Python, Linux control node.

- **Hybrid Cloud Network with AWS**

  - Designed and implemented a secure hybrid cloud network by connecting an on-premises Cisco environment (CML) to an AWS VPC over an IPsec VPN. Configured security groups, route tables, and firewall rules for optimal performance and security.

  - **Tech Stack:** CML (Cisco CSR Router), AWS VPC, IPsec VPN

- **Multi Protocol Network: OSPF, EIGRP, and BGP**

  -  Configured and troubleshooted route redistribution between OSPF, EIGRP, and BGP in a multi-protocol lab environment. Ensured seamless communication between different routing domains, improving interoperability.
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[View Repository](https://github.com/NetEngSam/Multi-Protocol-Network-OSPF-EIGRP-and-BGP)
  - **Tech Stack:** Cisco routers, Routing protocols (OSPF, EIGRP, BGP)

- **Ethical Hacking Exercises (Hack The Box)**   

  -  Currently 40% through Hack The Box‚Äôs Penetration Tester path, gaining hands on experience in enumeration, exploitation, and post exploitation techniques. Applied knowledge to assess and secure network vulnerabilities.
  -  **Tech Stack:** Kali Linux, Metasploit, Wireshark, Nmap.
